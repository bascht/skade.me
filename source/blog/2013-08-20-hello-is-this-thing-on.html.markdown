The title might set the tone: I am just plain bad at coming up with titles. But that will hopefully pass once I blog more.

So, I have some free time after [eurucamp](http://2013.eurucamp.org) and [JRubyConf.EU](http://2013.jrubyconf.eu) and decided to set up a blog. The reason is simple: "Why don't you write that down?" was a question I got asked more than once between sessions. I never bothered setting up a personal space on the internet. My company [Asquera](http://asquera.de) has a blog and I use it from time to time. But some topics just don't fit there, especially my personal thoughts and ideas.

So, here it is: my first personal blog, evar. Please stay tuned while I redecorate the interior a bit and start to hang up a few pretty pictures.

My first attempt at a title is "People and Things", because "People interacting with Technology" sounded even worse. But in general, thats what I am find most interesting about my job: how do people work with technology? How does it help them? What do they struggle with? Most likely, this will be what this blog revolves around the most.

For all that don't know me or are missing context: I'll write a proper introduction later. Welcome to my blog. While waiting, enjoy this pretty cat:
