<h1>$whoami</h1>
<p>My name is Florian Gilcher. Currently, I am a Berlin based Rubyist. Last years Florian is someone else and we tend not to get along. Oddly enough, I only moved to Berlin in June 2013, but was present in the community quite a while before. Before that, I lived in beautiful Speyer, Rhineland-Palatinate.</p>
<p>For about 3 years now, I run a small software consultancy called Asquera in Berlin together with my brother, Felix. While we are all good Ruby developers, our main focus is on building great infrastructures and backends - using any technology available.</p>
<p>Beyond my day job, I organize community events like eurucamp or germany.rb. I am involved in the Ruby Berlin e.V., a charity to support the programming language Ruby, and am honored to work with all the great people there. I do not only run conferences, but also speak at them. You can contact me for invitations, if you want to. My preference is clearly on community events with open and fair submission style.</p>
