# The Submission Problem

Following up another fight on Twitter, I'd like to clarify about getting woman and marginalized groups to speak on conferences.

When complaining about the lack of woman on stage (and, btw. as a consequence, the lack of woman attending), the statement of defense is the following:

    We picked the best and most fitting talks from the available pool of submissions.

That's a nice one, because that is what conference organizers should do: build a great program around the topic of the conference, not to bring token speakers on stage. The underlying problem here is that the _submission pool_ itself was already lacking relevant groups. This problem is known and there are tried and true processes to do so. Why not use them?

## Monitor Your Submissions

First of all, glance over your submissions from time to time. Even when running a blind CFP, you should check a least the ratio of men/woman ratio. Depending on where you run your conference, check for other relevant groups. When the numbers are off, alarm bells should go off.

This can only be fixed while the CFP is running, to allow fairness to all other participants.

## Reach Out

The biggest benefit is the internet is that there is a group for everything, including woman that speak about technology. Reach out to them. Indicate that you would like them to submit to your CFP. Listen to why they don't. The answers might range from a simple "we never heard of your conference" to "we see issues".

## Fix Issues

If any issues come up, do your best to fix them. Ask for reasons. Be aware that things that you might feel are not as important are still important reasons for the individual on the other end. "I don't feel welcome as a woman" might not require any active acts on your side - just running a conference in an industry that is not known to be woman-friendly might be enough. Running a conference in a country that has special travel remarks for woman can also be enough. Things like this can be fixed by simple acts, like providing a special contact in the organizing team provides assistance, by introducing a code of conduct and by making the conference friendlier to groups that have it harder to attend (e.g. parents). Be creative. First and foremost: fix individual issues, it is not your job to discuss the big picture.

Also, take care that you don't voluntarily introduce issues in the first place by neglect: for example, a venue that is not properly wheelchair-accessible might remove _you_ from access to a great set of speakers. Having a CFP by public voting might exclude people that don't feel comfortable with having their submissions judged out in the open, a problem that I suffer from. The reasons are as diverse as people.

## Experiences

jsconf.eu came up with a [very good and effective process to fix this issue]() that we adopted last year for [eurucamp](). Still, halfway through the CFP, we didn't have any submissions by woman. After focusing our outreach on this problem, we got a lot more submissions from which we could [pick in the end](). Those submissions where neither better nor worse than the previous. But: *The eurucamp program would have been much worse if we hadn't done so*, because we got a much better pool of topics and talks to pick from. Also, our [speaker list]() was living up to a standard we felt comfortable with. Note that I believe that this is still improvable. Getting more people to submit to a carefully constructed CFP is the best and fairest way to fix this problem by keeping everyone on the same level at the end.

## Who is not here?

We, as community organizers, have to give up the viewpoint that we just provide the stage and it is the individuals fault that they don't take it. We have a huge part in shaping communities by bringing people together. Even if we sell out conferences, we should always have a nagging question on the back of our head: "Who is not here?". Ask people that didn't attend or submit. Ask why. Take their issues seriously. There are many great technologists that _you_ are missing out if they ignore _your_ conference because of a simple issue that is in your hands to fix.

I think we are definitely entitled to complain if organizers don't meet this standard.

## But the effort!

Is overrated and worth every minute. Outreach is your main job as an organizer, reaching out to 5 groups more should be a managable effort.
