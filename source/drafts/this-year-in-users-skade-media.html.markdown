It is not quite christmas yet, but as I don't have the habit of consuming too much new media during around new years, I think it is safe to talk about my favourite things in media this year.

## Moving pictures are out

I didn't go that much to the movies as I would like to. I am still (proudly) stuck in season 4 of _BS:G_. Moving pictures just haven't been my thing this year, so I can only say: hopefully some more next year. I saw Iron Man II and III and found them both rather standard. Funny, but without surprises. I didn't even see an enragingly broken movie like last years _Prometheus_.

## Audio

There were 2 releases this year that definitely cought my ear: Daft Punks _Random Access Memories_ and Listeners _Time Is A Machine_ were probably my favorite records of the year.

_RAM_ shines through sheer musical brilliance. It is a carefully crafted record that successfully tries to be _Daft Punk_, but different. Most bands reinvent themselves and lose a lot of their charm in the process, _Daft Punk_ successfully avoids this problem. Every song on the album is immediately recognizable as a _Daft Punk_ song, despite dropping all of the french touch standards present in the previous albums. The drums are fantastic, the sythesizers sound as old as they should and the production makes every piece of your audio equipment worth the money. Favourite song: _Motherboard_ - regarded as a filler by some, this really defines the attention to detail this album has received. The song constantly evolves and is never quite like a few seconds ago.

_Time is a Machine_ is more of the same, but better. It follows the recipe of Listeners previous album, _Wooden Heart_: Simple, rocky songs built around Dan Smiths very intense spoken word lyrics. It is a combination you rarely get anywhere else. Song become poems and poems become songs. Favourite song: _Tornadoes_ - not a song for the sunny days, but a brilliant example how both music and lyrics can tell a story. Also, Listener don't fear the stage and are about the nicest people you can have in front of a mic.

## Video games

Two albums, three games: This year, those are _Rayman Legends_, _Remember Me_ and _The Last of Us_.

_Rayman Legends_ can be quickly described like its predecessor, _Rayman Origins_: handdrawn by frenchmen on dope (at least handdrawn and frenchmen are true). It is a light-hearted, exact and tough jump & run that really shows that 2D is still a thing. It is beautiful, creative, silly and a great multiplayer game. It is also enough of a departure from _Origins_ to stand on its own feet, especially with the supercool music levels.

_Remember Me_ is mediocre from a gameplay perspective. It definitely shows that it is not an AAA title despite trying hard to play in the same league. Gameplay-wise, it is competent, never enrages you, but is never as great as other competitors. So why the mention? Because the story avoids so many tropes that plague computer game story telling. The cast is refreshingly diverse and avoids stereotypes. The story itself touches interesting topics and has a good science-fiction spin that avoids Star Wars and errs towards Philip K. Dick. Sure, not everything is golden, but this game is a step in the right direction when it comes to storytelling and display of digital characters in games. I want to see more of that.

_The Last of Us_. A lot has been written about this game. For me, the most appreciated thing was that the makers of Uncharted, a game about exploding, burning and sinking setpieces, cut out the explosions and fires and replaced them by even more striking, but calm moments. _The Last of Us_ is a game that cheerfully draws a great vista of little town just so that the background is not so boring. On top of that, it has surprising moments of creativity that I don't want to spoil.  The story is mature story on so many levels: it is a game about a world infested by zombies, but keeps the number of encounters with zombies low and _very_ dangerous. This is no zombie slaughterhouse. The cast is taken seriously and the story doesn't avoid moments of controversity about the characters actions. Especially the ending is one that should be give one or the other thought and is definitely on the good side of "ambivalent".

## Books

I haven't read a lot of prose this year, mostly Alastair Reynolds _On The Steel Breeze_. If you are into hard scifi, it is recommendable as any of his books, but not special. It was striking that I only figured out that it is the middle part of a trilogy after reading the book. I didn't feel like missing out. The story rises and falls with your interest in stories about clones that can resynchronise their memories with lightyears in between them (yes, with year-long delay, thats a major part of the story). Also, as many of Reynolds stories, the story spans multiple decades.

I read Kahnemanns "Fast thinking, Slow Thinking", which was interesting, but I have not much to add about the book.
