Being at wroclove.rb, I just had a speaker on stage giving out advice on how
to get started with socialising and getting better at it. Besides the whole
talk using inappropriate imagery, one advice stood out as actively harmful:
**Drink alcohol to be more couragous and approach people**. Well,
don't.

## Alcohol at conferences

Alcohol itself is a fact of life at events and conferences. You might like it or
not and the conference might handle that in different fashion, but it will not
go away. Also, alcohol is not evil by itself - just something you should be
careful about. It is a drug usually used in groups and you might or might not
enjoy it - it still stays a drug.

## Effects of alcohol

The effects of alcohol are well known: it lowers your barriers and it impairs
judgement. It might lead to saying things you don't want to, making jokes that
don't fit or showing bad judgement about the appropriateness of your physical
actions. This _can_ be controlled, if you already know about how to behave
around the peer group you are in. Also, alcohol keeps you from remembering
the details of your actions or remembering a correct image of the last evening.


## Alcohol and socialising beginners

Put yourself into the shoes of a reluctant person anxious about getting
in contact with other people. I was that for a long time, I am sometimes today.

So, you have problems with interacting with people. Getting a conversation
started is hard, keeping it going is hard and not coming off as an ass or boring
is hard. Figuring out what went wrong is hard.

Now, the worst thing you can do is taking stuff that impairs your skills at
keeping track of all the things going on. In the worst case, you do things
under the influence that you will _really_ regret. Alcohol makes it harder to
recognize mistakes both during the conversation and after the fact.

Also, even if everything works out, you have learned nothing at the next morning -
at worst, you found that you need a drug to interact with people.

## Drinking alcohol for the wrong reasons

There are reasons to drink alcohol in measure - enjoyment is one of them. Shared
enjoyment is okay as well, just make sure it is no must and non-drinkers feel fine.

Getting better at socialising is the worst reason. It is of no use, at worst harmful
and there are better ways to do so.

Heres mine: go somewhere with a friend. Ask that person to introduce you and help
you with the discussion by throwing you balls. Listen to criticism afterwards.
