Jan reminded me that I wanted to elaborate on this one:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>The most important question for any successful event (especially a sold out one) is:&#10;&#10;“Who is not here, and why?”&#10;&#10;(Paraphrasing <a href="https://twitter.com/Argorak">@Argorak</a>)</p>&mdash; Jan Lehnardt (@janl) <a href="https://twitter.com/janl/statuses/416553349497233408">December 27, 2013</a></blockquote>

I think the question is a very interesting one for two reasons: first, it is an inherently hard one, that also means it is interesting to tackle. Second, it yields the best feedback.

We, as organizers, can easily shift the blame away from us, on the community, of the amount of work involved (without checking) or the general state of the nation.

Through chance, I got to talk to a few people about the events I was involved in and why they attended or don't attend. This doesn't always involve the whole event, some of the discussions involved particular subevents. If you are running an event for the second time, you could even talk to people that chose not to buy a second ticket.

## A different perspective

The question is a mental reversal: instead of focusing what we did right to make people gather in a room, try to find out what made others stay at home. The reasons can range from standard communication problems ("I didn't know you did A and B"), practical ones ("your location wasn't easily reachable with a wheelchair") to things that don't click in your head immediately. Some even might sound odd at first. Luckily, all can be approached with the same strategy.

## Very serious

Take all of those complaints very serious, even if you can't fix them (now). They are the most valuable feedback you have. Rarely do people come at you and complain for no reason. Yes, there are trolls and I had them, but most people criticise you because they feel like something wasn't working that way.

Strangly, thats often not what happens. Instead, reactions to various complaints often range from denial to open ridicule. If done in open, especially in social media, this gives fertile ground for the next shitstorm.

Instead: Engage in a (preferably closed) conversation and you will find that most of them have a point. Don't argue the correctness of their complaint (or worse: ridicule it). Try to fix things or try to explain why you cannot. Say sorry in a kind way if you cannot. Fix it next time, if possible. It is a bit of legwork to get at the core of a complaint, but in my experience, there are worthwhile discussions to be had with anyone.

## Don't expect to understand

There are reasons I cannot connect to. They neither match my experience nor can I emphasize enough with the other person to fully understand what is going on. This doesn't mean that we cannot work out a solution. Thats the whole job of an organizer. And that is the other part of the reversal: the other person doesn't have to explain her/himself to me. It works the other way around: I want to understand what I can do to mitigate that problem, nothing more, nothing less. 

This doesn't mean that I have to implement any suggestion I am not convinced of, but it sets the right tone: let's talk and I will give you at least a good explanation if I cannot implement it.

## You sold out, why do you bother?

Because I can and I want to. Selling out gives a warm fuzzy feeling. Actually meeting people didn't attend or didn't enjoy because of something that is in my hand still gives me a headache. I organize community events because they give us the chance to transform communities for the better, not to wave around with attendee numbers. Even in a success, there is always something that didn't work as planned.

Next up: who is not on stage?
