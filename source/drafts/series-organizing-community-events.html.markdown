The first thing I figured out when I started running community events: there is not much written about how that actually works. A few years later, the situation is not better. This is why I am kicking off this blog with a series of articles on how to run a conference.

My current plan for topics is:

* Outset: why would you even want to run an event?
* "Awesome!": what makes an event great?
* Together: what differs a community event from a professional conference?
* Starting out: what kind of event should it be? What so you want to achieve?
* Shortcut: running something very small.
* Communication I: how to communicate before the event.
* Code of conduct and diversity: why it matters, why to think of it early and how to work towards it.
* Finding a venue: what to look out for, what never to accept. The subtle conveniences.
* Invitations and CFP: how to get (the right) people for your event
* Funding: how to get money, including what to do if you cannot raise enough.
* Tickets: ticket sale is an art.
* Communication II: before and during the conference.
* Stress: The days before the conference.
* More Stress: The days of the conference.
