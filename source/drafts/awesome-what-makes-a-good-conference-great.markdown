Have you ever been on an event and really enjoyed it, but you don't quite know why? Some refer to it as "magic" or "unique", but the more I go to conferences, I don't believe there is such a thing. You cannot force an event to be one of those things, but you can certainly help. What happened, when many attendees refer to an event like this? Also, what happened when people dislike conferences that look great on paper?

As many things, the enjoyment of a conference is a combination of many elements. Community conferences especially are not only attended for the content, but also to meet people and interact. I organized rather small conferences (< 400 people), but yet we had people flying in from as far as Chile and Japan to visit us - those people care about who they meet. No amount of good content can make the burden of travel worth it alone. On the other hand, you have local attendees that most likely know all other local attendees already - these attend for the people you manage to pull in, especially speakers.

A good conference means that you can cater to all those different people. Enjoyment is viral - if everyone feels cared for at the conference, you will cross the threshold where most people enjoyed the conference and start speaking very favourably. This touches the topic of handling diversity a bit, but I'll cover that later.

## Content

Still, content should not be underrated. Much in contrast, it is the basis of a good conference. Conferences are places where people share their knowledge with others freely and after every conference, I hope to go home with at least one thing I want to try out tomorrow. Most likely, one of the speakers will tell me that.

A coherent set of topics that sets expectations beforehand and manages to deliver is one part of that. Another are the surprises. The new speaker that no one has ever heard of that has an interesting new topic. The technical speaker who suddenly, out of the blue, gives a moving inspirational talk. An off-topic talk that you cannot make sense before, but can afterwards. A great conference has all of them.

This is, by the way, the reason why I rarely buy tickets to fully invited "rockstar" conferences - all speakers are seasoned veterans, so surprises will be rare. They rarely go beyond "good, as expected".

## Interaction

Attendees are not mere sheep. A great conference involves them somehow - through lightning talks, BOF sessions, activities or just by allocating free time. eurucamp is very well known for allocating lots of free time and conciously not planning through everything. And guess what? Attendees fill the blanks and even enjoy that. They didn't buy a ticket for a rollercoaster ride, but for a playground. Especially when one of the goals of the conference is growing of the community, the value of free time is often underrated.

## Transformative value

This is the hardest part to steer, but also the best if it pays of. It is also something that you can only enable, but never make sure that it happens. On top of that, it rarely shows itself to you, as an organizer.

Community events with a transformative component bring the community forward. Something changes and nothing is like it was before. To give you an example: for me, my best conference ever was EuRuKo 2007. Why? Because it broke a lot of barriers down and changed the face of the Ruby community. Rack was announced there. The decision to start moving the EuRuKo - now a cult conference - around europe yearly was made there. By all other measures, EuRuKo 2007 was an amateurish conference in a lecture room in an empty university with no food around and mediocre talks. But, by chance, it had a lot of impact.

## Environment

This is last, because, as I've just shown, food isn't that important. Still, everyone enjoys a good coffee, a venue with good WiFi, good parties and his sleeping place nearby. But here is a small secret: If you don't provide, people will just ensure that they get it. At eurucamp 2012, we had to skip one evening of parties for budgeting reasons. Turned out, it was one of the best decisions we ever made - people enjoyed a free evening without pressure much better.
