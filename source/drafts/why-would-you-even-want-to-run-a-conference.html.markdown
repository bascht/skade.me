Or, for that matter, any kind of community event? Let's put the ugly truth first: If I wanted to boost my carreer, there are better ways than running events. Fame can also be gathered in much better ways (like, say, building a big framework that gets you invited to conferences). It is incredibly exhaustive, eats up a lot of your free time and it only gets worse with the scope of the event. So, why should you do it?

Mind that I said scope here. Running a 250 people one-track event with everyone in one room is not that much different from running the same with 600 people - you just have to sell more tickets and find and approriate venue. But adding things like child care, running a more complex CFP, more days or multiple venues make the whole thing and more exhaustive. In the other direction, smaller events can be run with almost no planning, hence lesser exhaustion.

Still, all that is work that you - except if you are a professional conference organizer - usually have to do in your free time.

Which brings me back to the initial question: why? Why would someone do this?

I think it comes down to what kind of person you are. If I had to, I would roughly split communities in 3 groups: people that take no interest in the community at all, people that enjoy interacting with each other, either on mailing lists or on events (this includes both speakers and attendees) and those that provide the last group with the platforms to do so. They pay for a server to keep a bulleting board running for a decade, run mailing lists or organize events in the physical world, like user groups and conferences.

If the last sentence sounded cool to you, you should definitely meet up with your local users group and start getting involved. If there is none, try to start one.

All of these people I met have some things in common: a love for their topic, a sense of belonging through that topic and a enjoyment for working with other people. The feeling of having done something that 20 people enjoyed and valued very strongly is hard to describe, but they crave for it. The best ones know how they can form communities and change their path. Quite a few of them see their work as their contribution to the community, instead of something else.

I, for example, am actually a very bad committer to open source, I usually drop the ball after a few month end even my own projects tend to lie bare after a while. My way of saying "thanks" to the OS community is by providing it with other services, like the ability to chat over a beer at Lake MÃ¼ggelsee every year.

So, this is what it comes down to: an intrinsic need to give something to the community you belong to. And every community needs these people very much.
